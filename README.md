## ITLA 29 Toolkit

### Overview

This repository is meant to house all final project-related materials from the
California Department of Technology IT Leadership Academy, cohort 29 (ITLA 29).

The folders found in this repository are designed to organize the materials
produced by the ITLA 29 cohort. There are three sub-folders in this directory,
each containing one or more files that we hope will help in your telework
efforts, no matter where you are in the journey.

All of the toolkit deliverables can be used as stand-alone artifacts. There is
no document or tool that is dependent on another. That being said, there are
some synergies between toolkit deliverables, so you may find using multiple
items more helpful than using just one.

### Context - Folder Contents

A breakdown of each folder is found below:

- Cohort Research
  - This folder is meant to capture some of our research notes and findings. We
    are including it here for those that are interested in how we created some
    of our materials and the definitions we used when creating our deliverables.
    The information contained in this folder is supplementary and it is not
    necessary to review these documents in order to use other toolkit
    deliverables.
- Quick Reference Guide
  - This folder is meant to capture the 'one-pager' types of deliverables that
    are often used as quick reference or desk reference guides.
- Survey and Assessment Questions
  - This folder is meant to capture documents related to interview and survey
    questions. One document contains questions which can be used to assess an
    organization's desire and readiness for telework; the other documents found
    in this folder relate to assessing an organization's work relationships and
    culture.
