# ITLA 29 Toolkit

## Overview

This page is meant to house all final project-related materials from the
California Department of Technology IT Leadership Academy, cohort 29 (ITLA 29).

There are three groups of materials - Cohort Research, Quick Reference Guides,
and Survey and Assessment Questions. Each group contains one or more files that
we hope will help in your telework efforts, no matter where you are in the
journey.

All of the toolkit deliverables can be used as stand-alone artifacts. That being
said, there are some synergies between toolkit deliverables, so you may find
using multiple items more helpful to use multiple artifacts together rather than
using just one.

## Context - Folder Contents

A breakdown of each folder is found below:

- Cohort Research
  - This folder is meant to capture some of our research notes and findings. We
    are including it here for those that are interested in how we created some
    of our materials and the definitions we used when creating our deliverables.
    The information contained in this folder is supplementary and it is not
    necessary to review these documents to use other toolkit deliverables.
- Presentation Slide Deck
  - This folder contains the slide deck used during the ITLA 29 presentation.
- Quick Reference Guide
  - This folder is meant to capture the 'one-pager' types of deliverables that
    are often used as a quick reference or desk reference guides.
- Survey and Assessment Questions
  - This folder is meant to capture documents related to interview and survey
    questions. One document contains questions that can be used to assess an
    organization's desire and readiness for telework; the other documents found
    in this folder relate to assessing an organization's work relationships and
    culture.
