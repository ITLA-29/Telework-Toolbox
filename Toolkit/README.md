# ITLA 29 Toolkit

## Breadcrumb

- [INDEX](../README.md)

## Overview

This Toolkit folder is designed to organize the materials produced by the ITLA
29 cohort. There are four sub-folders in this directory, each containing one or
more files that we hope will help in your telework efforts, no matter where you
are in the journey.

All of the toolkit deliverables can be used as stand-alone artifacts. There is
no document or tool that is dependent on another. That being said, there are
some synergies between toolkit deliverables, so you may find that using multiple
items is more helpful than using just one.

## Context - Folder Contents

A breakdown of each folder is found below:

- Cohort Research
  - This folder is meant to capture some of our research notes and findings. We
    are including it here for those that are interested in how we created some
    of our materials and the definitions we used when creating our deliverables.
    The information contained in this folder is supplementary and it is not
    necessary to review these documents in order to use other toolkit
    deliverables.
- Quick Reference Guide
  - This folder is meant to capture the 'one-pager' types of deliverables that
    are often used as quick reference or desk reference guides.
- Survey and Assessment Questions
  - This folder is meant to capture documents related to interview and survey
    questions. One document contains questions can be used to assess employee's
    desire and readiness for telework; the other documents found in this folder
    relate to assessing your organization's work relationships and culture.
