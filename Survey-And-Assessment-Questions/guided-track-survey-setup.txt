Hello, and thank you for participating in this survey!

As part of the Information Technology Leadership Academy (ITLA) 29, we have designed this survey to help State leaders better understand the successes and pain points around work cultures and relationships to assist in building more meaningful tools and best practices for use across the State.

Your survey responses will remain anonymous and may be used for research and presentation purposes.

This survey consists of 26 questions and should take approximately 7 minutes.
